Apollo
======

Apollo is a software to manage your music library. It stores your artists, albums, musics in json files, saving all information (ID3 tags) and, if possible, where from you downloaded the musics, albums, etc. This way, Apollo can download all your library with just one touch.

Apollo is still under development. Feel free to help.

***

##Todo:
* Edit Json inside Apollo
* Set folders where Apollo will monitor your musics. If you add something new, it'll know
* Organize your musical library
* If you imported a new library, show which tracks/albums are missing and let you (if possible) download them
* Export folders as a Apollo library (json file)
